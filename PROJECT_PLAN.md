## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Models
- **Users**: Profile, goals, dietary restrictions, preferences
- **Foods**: Nutritional information, serving sizes
- **Meals**: User meal logs with timestamp and portions
- **Recipes**: Instructions, ingredients, nutritional info
- **Activities**: Fitness activities from external integrations
- **Goals**: User-defined health/fitness objectives

### Relationships
- Users have many Meals, Recipes, Activities, Goals
- Meals contain many Foods (many-to-many)
- Recipes contain many Foods (many-to-many)
- Activities belong to Users
